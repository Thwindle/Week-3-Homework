    <p> <em>Why do I like games?</em> 
    <br>
		They're fun! Have you ever seen a clip like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8vGaC4OZIs">this?</a> <br>
		Well maybe that didn't make much sense to you, if you don't know much about the game. <br>
		But League of Legends is huge! Just look at how many people play this game! <br> 
		This is a picture of the viewership for the past couple years. <h3> <img src="https://rankedkings.com/img/blog/league-of-legends-worlds-finals-viewership.png"> <br>
		Each of these are in the <strong>MILLIONS!</strong> of viewers by years. </h3>

	<h4> <em>Music</em>: </h4> <br>
    <p> Music has been a huge part of my life and continues to be. I will continue to use it even in my field as a Recreation Therapist! One of my favourite songs I've been enjoying recently <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q9DWZLaY2U">is</a> Here is some of my favourite kinds of music </p>
		<h4><table class = "center";>
			<tr> <td> <b>Likes</b> <td> <b>Dislikes</b>

			<tr> <td>K-pop <td>Screamo
			<tr> <td>pop/country <td>Techno

	<h5> <b>Another thing I enjoy!</b> </h5>
	<p>Something else I really love in Anime. I used to be afraid of sharing this but now, I am okay with it. Here's a fun little clip I've always <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TzmO0Uv20s&ab_channel=RIXXCHANNEL">enjoyed.</a> Although that might not have made much sense, so here's a really generic one that people can enjoy with knowing what is <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEIZZBIfIB0&ab_channel=animelab">happening!</a>
	<br>
	<br>
	My favourite genres of anime are:
	<ul>
		<li> Romance</li>
		<li> Music </li>
		<li> Action </li>
		<li> Slice of Life </li>
		<li> Drama </li>
		<li> Magic </li>
		<li> Isekai (another world)</li>
		<li> Fantasy </li>
	</ul>
	Whereas I don't enjoy:
	<ul>
		<li>Horror</li>
		<li>Mecha</li>
		<li>Gore (lots of blood)</li>
		<li>and many others</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	As you can see, I enjoy a lot of genres and don't dislike as many, although the ones I dislike are pretty common for the older shows.
</p>
<p> <em>You know though?</em> Something Anime has taught me is that I need to be myself. <b><em>I shouldn't be afraid of being myself.</em></b> If people like me then that's awesome but if not, then that's too bad. I've brought this with me throughout my time as a Recreation Therapist, to explore my own interests at all times instead of <em>forcing myself to be like someone else.</em> </p>
